# python-snippets-and-utilities


A collection of small Python scripts, exercises, and utility functions I created while learning and practicing Python.  
This repository includes examples of:

- Basic data structures  
- File I/O  
- Numerical computing with NumPy  
- Simple OOP usage  
- A minimal linear regression model implemented from scratch  

These snippets are intended as learning references and reusable utilities.
